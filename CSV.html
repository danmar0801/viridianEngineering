            <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
            <p>Computer systems used to create, modify, and maintain electronic records and manage electronic signatures are subject to validation requirements to ensure accuracy, reliability, consistent intended performance, and the ability to discern invalid
                or altered records. ViridianTech <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/part-11-electronic-records-electronic-signatures-scope-and-application">CFR Part 11 compliance reviews</a> are based on
                a justified and documented risk assessment and a determination of the potential for the system to affect product quality, patient safety, and record integrity. Viridian Engineers will work with you to review your existing validation procedures
                and documentation to identify any gaps in validation, define any remediation activities, and develop a training approach to ensure maintenance of compliance once our project is complete.</p>
