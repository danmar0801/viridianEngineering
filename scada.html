        <h2 class="section-title">Why Us</h2>
        <p>Every business has its own processes and approach to getting things done, and SCADA systems need to reflect that unique culture. This is YOUR equipment and YOUR data. ViridianTechs’s seasoned crew of SCADA programmers knows that clearly presented
            information, intuitive system controls, and clear navigation are the core of good SCADA/HMI programming. We can design to your standards, or if you don’t yet have standards, we have some great ones. Either way, we’ll involve you every step
            of the way so that you end up with a system you love.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section info" style="margin-top: 25px;">
        <h2 class="section-title">SUPERVISORY CONTROL</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Centralized monitoring and control of your industrial equipment is a great starting point for any digitalization initiative. Knowing what your processing equipment or manufacturing line is doing in real time from a control room or mobile device
            has obvious operational advantages, but SCADA systems can also serve as the foundation for an automated data collection strategy for your enterprise.</p>
        <p>One of the most under-valued tasks on many SCADA projects is UI design. Overly complex or visually distracting systems significantly reduce the effectiveness of these systems and are unacceptable. We channel our inner-designer when designing screens
            and follow basic graphic design rules like color coordination, information grouping, and consistently applied fonts and iconography. You’re going to like the way your screens look.</p>

    <section class="section info" style="margin-top: 25px;">
        <h2 class="section-title">HISTORIANS & REPORTING</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Historians are pretty standard components of all SCADA packages today, and most come with great built-in tools for reviewing historical trends and some basic reporting. Getting actionable information from very large data sets is easier said than
            done though, and special skill-sets and tools are often required to find the information needle in the data haystack.</p>
        <p>ViridianTechs goes beyond just installing a historian and connecting it to the plant floor. Our team is trained and experienced in manipulating SQL databases, creating custom reports, and applying advanced analytics tools. While we always prefer
            off the shelf solutions from one of our partners, we aren’t limited to them for solving more complex data challenges. Whatever your data collection and reporting needs, we have you covered.</p>

    <section class="section info" style="margin-top: 25px;">
        <h2 class="section-title">UPGRADES & MIGRATIONS</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">SCADA systems are more prone to obsolescence than other industrial automation components and require updating much more frequently. Maintaining support with your SCADA software vendor and regularly updating SCADA software operating systems and
            servers is critical. ViridianTechs can manage these updates for you while keeping your plant assets operational.</p>
        <p>When updates are not regularly managed, SCADA systems will force your hand. Older software won't operate on new operating systems, new operating systems won't operate on old hardware, and old hardware eventually dies. Fear not! ViridianTechs transforms
            obsolete control systems into modern technology platforms with wide-open opportunity for system improvements. Today’s SCADA software has a bigger bag of tricks than just visualization and reporting. The investment in an upgrade will lay the
            foundation for a larger digitalization strategy including MES, analytics, and more.</p>

    <section class="section info" style="margin-top: 25px;">
        <h2 class="section-title">ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">For businesses with multiple facilities an enterprise SCADA solution brings the value of a plant-level SCADA to the entire organization. View real-time operational information for any facility from a central location. Compare operational performance
            across the organization and tie data from all facilities into enterprise level software systems like ERP. Enable your team with the data to shift from reactive to proactive production management. </p>
        <p>ViridianTechs is uniquely positioned to provide enterprise solutions in industrial environments. Our team of industrial networking gurus get your data from the plant floor to the enterprise level, our database experts make sure the data is stored
            reliably, and our industrial programmers bring the system to life with intelligently designed dashboards and reports securely accessible from anywhere. </p>
